## 🧠 About Me

```python
class Sasank:
    role = "AI / ML Engineer & Researcher"
    focus = ["LLMs", "RAG Systems", "ML Pipelines", "Data-Centric AI"]
    research_interests = [
        "Representation Learning",
        "Multimodal & Scientific Imaging",
        "Knowledge-Augmented AI",
        "Robust AI Systems"
    ]
    philosophy = "Research-driven, system-oriented, production-aware"
```

I’m a **Computer Science (AI/ML) undergraduate at VIT Chennai (CGPA 9.62)** working at the intersection of:

* **AI research**
* **applied machine learning**
* **production ML systems**

I enjoy taking ideas from papers, prototypes, or experiments — and turning them into **working, measurable, deployable systems**.

My work spans **LLMs, retrieval systems, computer vision, data pipelines, and ML infrastructure**, with full-stack engineering used as a *tool* to ship intelligence into the real world.

## 🔬 Research & Engineering Focus

* **LLM & RAG Systems**

  * Knowledge-graph–augmented RAG
  * RAG evaluation (RAGAS, metric-driven comparison)
  * Retrieval, grounding, hallucination reduction

* **Machine Learning Research**

  * Vision Transformers & Swin Transformers
  * Scientific & hyperspectral imaging
  * Classical ML for security & telemetry data

* **ML Engineering & Systems**

  * GPU inference optimization (H100, batch sizing, memory planning)
  * ML pipelines, background workers, evaluation loops
  * Model serving & API integration

* **Supporting Infrastructure**

  * FastAPI, Next.js, Redis, Postgres
  * Dockerized deployments
  * Cloud-based ML services


## 🏢 Experience

### **Research Intern — Australian Plant Phenomics Network (APPN)**

*Dec 2025 – Present*

* Working on **hyperspectral imaging pipelines** for plant phenotyping
* Processing RGB-D & SWIR data for stress and moisture analysis
* Studying sensor calibration, noise, and spectral representations

### **Software Development Intern — Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)**

*May 2025 – Dec 2025*

* Deployed LLM inference pipelines (Qwen, gpt-oss-20b) on H100 GPUs
* Optimized memory usage, batching, and throughput
* Integrated LLM services into backend systems via APIs

### **Research Intern — Seton Hall University (Cybersecurity Lab)**

*Nov 2024 – Apr 2025*

* Built ML classifiers for attack detection in Zero Trust environments
* Conducted full ML lifecycle: data → features → models → evaluation
* Documented limitations and real-world deployment tradeoffs


## 🛠️ Technical Stack
